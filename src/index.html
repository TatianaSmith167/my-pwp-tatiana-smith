<p class = "text-2xl m-2 p-5 text-center"> About me..</p>
<p class = "text-fuchsia-500 font-thin text-xs m-2 p-5 shadow-purple-800"> I am 25 years old, and I'm currently going through the bootcamp for Fullstack Web Development.  I have a two-year-old daughter named Nylah who has the most energy I've ever seen in a child and I wanted to really get into a solid career to give her a better future.  I have always been very interested in technology.  My last three jobs were regarding tech support for phones and Mac computers. Before this bootcamp, I did dip my toe into the art world.  I'm self-taught and here are a few pieces that I think show who I am..

        <p class = "text-teal-300 font-thin text-sm m-5 p-5 shadow-purple-800"> This one right here is pretty special to me because it's from about half-way into my art journey and I can see how much I improved on some techniques.  Plus, I was really inspired by a lot of movies, specifically Studio Ghibli, which I feel encapsulates a lot of emotions that are hard to explain and that's kind of what I was hoping to do with my artwork.</p>

        <p class = "text-teal-300 font-thin text-sm m-2 shadow-purple-800"> This is a more recent piece which was for an album cover.  It was the first time doing a piece for someone else that would actually be put on a platform where others can see it.  I was definitely nervous about it because I felt I wasn't ready just yet, but I went ahead and did it and people gave me really great feedback about it, and I was happy I did it.   </p>
