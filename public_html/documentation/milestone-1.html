            <strong>Purpose</strong> This project was made to present my personal progression with my different areas of interest.  It was also made to display my ability to teach myself new skills by doing my own research and putting in the time and effort for it. <br>

            <br><strong>Audience</strong> The website is targeted to potential employers, people who have an interest for art, script-writing, and tech, my peers, and anyone who is interested in getting to know more about me.  <br>

            <br><strong>Goal</strong> The goal of building this website is to showcase my dedication and willingness to learn something new to potential employers, peers, and recruiters. My secondary goal for creating this website is to show my work thus far. <br>

        <strong>Name</strong> Michael Scott<br>

        <br><strong>Profession</strong> New owner and CEO of Michael Scott Paper Company.  <br>

        <br><strong>Tech</strong> Average tech user.  He owns an Asus Zenbook laptop and an iPhone 15.   <br>

        <br><strong>Attitudes / Behaviors</strong> Michael has a busy schedule throughout the week which can cause him stress. He does not like to spend too much time sifting through potential employees and interns; therefore, appreciates when someone can quickly and clearly display the necessary attributes for the position.  <br>

        <br><strong>Frustrations / Needs</strong> Michael needs to get a team of Fullstack Developers together to create his website for ordering paper.  He gets frustrated when there's too much going on visually that it distracts from the website but also does not like when there's not enough; making the website uninteresting for his users.  He needs his website to be visually pleasing, yet simple and fully functional. <br>

        <br><strong>Goals</strong> Michael's goal on this website is to quickly find my skills and examples of what I've done to determine if I'm right for the project.<br>

        <br><strong>User Story</strong> As a new user, I need to easily find and navigate through Tatiana's abilities and talent to determine if she would be able to handle the project.
