<h1>Milestone Part 2</h1>
<p class="center">My plan for this website is to keep it simple but try to do a lot with the styling; such as colors, grids, buttons and how users will interact with the page.


 <br>Underneath the nav bar I'm including a rounded picture of myself next to a block of text that says a little bit of information about me and what I was doing before the bootcamp.  Under that, I will have pictures of art that I've done, maybe starting from my first drawings and doodles to what I've recently created with a little description under the pictures. Under that section, I want to have another section about how I decided to get into coding maybe including how I've worked in tech support. I also want to include where I hope to go after completing the bootcamp. Under that I can have more pictures of me. </br>
