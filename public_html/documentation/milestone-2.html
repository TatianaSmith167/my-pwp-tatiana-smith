<h1>Milestone Part 2</h1>
<p class="center">My plan for this website is to keep it simple but try to do a lot with the styling; such as colors, grids, buttons and how users will interact with the page.

<br>If I have enough data for it, I will be adding a nav bar to navigate to a second page.  Each page will show different interests of mine and the progress in the work I've done in a grid row format. </br>

 <br>Underneath the nav bar I'm including a rounded picture of myself next to a block of text that says a little bit of information about me.  Under that, I will have pictures of art that I've done and a little description under it. (If I decide to add more interests I will create a wireframe for the second page, I just don't have clear pictures of it so I'm trying to work out how to add those in there .)</br>
