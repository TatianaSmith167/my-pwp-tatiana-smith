<br>A little bit about me.. <br>

    <br> I am 25 years young and I'm currently going through the bootcamp for Fullstack Web Development.  Before this, I dipped my toe into art from doodling and using Procreate. I have a two-year-old daughter who has the most energy I've ever seen in a child and I wanted to really get into a solid career to give her a better future.  I have always been very interested in technology.  My last three jobs were regarding tech support for phones and Mac computers.

    Pictures


    <h3> This is from when I first started drawing.  It isn't perfect of course.  This one I did on a computer using Photoshop.  I didn't have all the talent, but I did have the spirit!  I haven't taken any classes for art, I've been teaching myself through YouTube and just jumping in to try something new. </h3>

    <img src="../img/sad-face.JPG" height="1440" width="1440"/><h4> This is from about half way into my art journey.  As you can see, I improved on some techniques and kept trying to really get my pictures where I want them to be.  I was inspired by a lot of animated movies.  When I am inspired, I like to try things right away.  Even if I don't have much knowledge yet.  Which is why I tried baking for awhile because I do love food and love the science behind making meals and deserts extraordinary.  </h4>

I feel this does display my willingness to put my all into something I'm interested in.  </h5>
